          <p><em>Posted by <a href="people.html#cam">Cam</a> on 2019-03-14</em></p>
          <p>A shorter post now, following on from last week’s <a href="blog5.html">post on phenotype standardization</a>. It’s all well and good to theorize about Taxon × Character (T × C) matrices, but until the data are created we don’t have anything to actually work with or share. I mentioned in that post our current project to create and integrate data for 12 characters for all the Alaskan plant taxa (ca. 2,300). We’ve recently been joined by <a href="people.html#brian">Brian Heitz</a>, a botanist with long Alaska experience, who has begun to collect these data, combing through a wide array of written and digital sources.</p>
          <p>The question immediately arose, “How best to enter these data into a data management system?” If all we wanted was the single phenotype datum for each T × C combination, the cells in a spreadsheet might have sufficed (with all the usual caveats about using a spreadsheet as a database). But for each phenotype we also want to record metadata: date entered, entered by who, sources, and any comments on the scoring, e.g. about uncertainty. Without having large, hard-to-parse cell values, a single spreadsheet table will not work.</p>
          <p>The first, quick-fix solution was to use a spreadsheet where each row was the character data and metadata for each T × C combination. Using the “Data validation” capabilities of Google Sheets, one can create a drop-down menu containing all the taxa in the first cell of a row, and a dropdown menu containing all the characters and states in the second (by referring to ranges in other sheets). The combination of these two is the main T × C datum, and the remaining cells in a row contain metadata:</p>
          <p><img src="../img/app0.png" alt="GSheet" style="width:80%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display:block;"/></p>
          <p>This is a perfectly workable solution, and the main table can be dumped to CSV and easily parsed prior to entry into a database, and Brian used this for several weeks. However, this spreadsheet user experience is quite time-consuming (e.g., scrolling through all the dropdown taxa each time a line is created), somewhat error-prone, and it’s hard to monitor ones progress and the percentage completeness of a genus. So I set about writing a data-entry app just for this project. It’s been fun tuning the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface">UI</a>” and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience">UX</a>” via frequent feedback from Brian. Not an experience I’ve had before, despite making a bunch of web-apps, most being developed under the unrealistic hope that “if I make it, someone will use it”!</p>
          <p>The product is working well, and might be of some use to others, so I’ll describe it briefly here. The app is a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">Awk</a> <a href="https://github.com/akflora/akflora/blob/master/alaskaflora.org/chars/do">file</a> (plus 3 function libraries and a MySQL DB; schema <a href="../chars/chars.sql">here</a>), running as a CGI script on a web server (optionally password protected via <code>.htpasswd</code>).</p>
          <p>The landing page displays a list of genera, showing the number of species and infraspecific taxa:</p>
          <p><img src="../img/app1.png" alt="Webapp page 1" style="width:50%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display:block;"/></p>
          <p>The “% done” column is the completed-ness of that genus, which is the percentage of filled-in cells in the genus T × C matrix. Clicking on the genus name takes you to the matrix view:</p>
          <p><img src="../img/app3.png" alt="Webapp matrix" style="width:80%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display:block;"/></p>
          <p>The first entry is the genus. For the species of some genera a character may have an unvarying state, and entering the state once, at the genus level, will greatly increase the rate of data entry. When a character state is entered at this genus level, that state appears in blue for all the taxa in the genus. The precise definition of this is important: entering a character state at the genus level <em>only</em> implies that for all the included taxa <em>in this list</em> (i.e., in Alaska) the state is believed to to be unvarying. It is <em>not</em> implying that the phenotype is an apomorphy for the genus clade.</p>
          <p>Below the genus are the included taxa, and data can be entered for any T × C combination, even if the character has been scored at the genus level. Clicking on the “taxon notes” cell enables a note to be made about the taxon. Clicking on the “fill” cell enables the character data for one taxon to be copied to another. To enter data in a cell, the cell is clicked on and the data-entry page appears:</p>
          <p><img src="../img/app4.png" alt="Webapp entry page" style="width:80%;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display:block;"/></p>
          <p>A character state is chosen, along with metadata: one or more source codes (e.g., <code>hult</code> = Hultén, <code>judd</code> = <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/917308694">Judd et al.</a>, <code>inat</code> = <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>), and notes. When entering data for a genus, a source can be entered that supports the state being consistent for all included taxa, or the code <code>ASC</code> can be used that means “all species checked”. Polymorphisms are allowed, i.e., two or more states for a character. This implies that <em>either</em> different individuals in a taxon may show variation for this character, <em>or</em> that individuals often show two or more states (e.g., apparently entire and non-entire leave margins, or blue and purple flowers). Such a polymorphism statement may also appear at the genus level, implying all taxa show this variation. Additionally, an <code>X</code> state can be score for any character, which allows a comment to be made for the T × C cell without yet committing to a choice of character state.</p>
          <p>The choice of the combination of character and character state creates a statement about the phenotype of a taxon, as per the <a href="blog5.html">previous blog</a>. Note that the options are presented to the user in the standard DELTA fashion of <code>Character + Character state</code> not <code>Entity + Quality</code>, the former being, I think, the more natural way of speaking of a phenotype. However, each of the available phenotypes in this app is one of the phenotypes included in the <a href="../onto/plantchars.ttl">ontology</a>, in which most of the phenotypes are mapped to their “EQ” representation.</p>
          <p>The task of scoring these characters for all our taxa is a large one, but Brian is off to a great start, and says he finds this data entry and editing tool to be useful and quick.</p>
