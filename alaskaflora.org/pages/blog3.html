          <h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
          <p>A single taxonomic name often occurs in different forms in different publications. In terms of character string differences, the variation may be slight (e.g., a missing space after an author’s initials, or a single character mispelling of a specific epithet), or major (e.g., a missing basionym). Consider: <code>Ciminalis prostrata (Haenke) Á. Löve &amp; D. Löve</code> vs. <code>Ciminalis prostrata (Haenke) A.Love &amp; D.Love</code> vs. <code>Ciminalis prostrata Love &amp; Love</code>. These variations sometimes arise via copying or data entry errors, but more often are created through the choices of how to encode the history of a name that are made by authors citing an earlier name: to add the basionym or not, to treat a validly publishing author as an “ex” author or as the main author, and how to abbreviate the authors’ names. While the <em><a href="https://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php">International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants</a></em> contains precise rules for name citation (Articles 46-50), there are also many reccomendations and often several “correct” ways to cite a name. The Code has also evolved over time, and many citations were published before clear rules existed. Hence the same name is often cited validly in a variety of forms, as well as being cited in erroneous ways. These citations find their way into databases and therefore present problems for the integration of data, whether it is linking synonyms to valid names, or linking secondary data from different sources.</p>
          <h2 id="name-matching">Name matching</h2>
          <p>How do we then determine if two variants of a names are really “the same?” I.e., despite the variation, do these two name strings refer to the same name as <em>first published</em>. No judgement about the taxon concept (or circumscription) of the names is being attempted at this step. The most reliable way to solve this question is to track down the usage(s) of both names in the primary literature and carefully determine if the autors were refering to the same name as originally published. While this approach is feasible in the case of a taxonomist performing a revision, it is too slow to incorporate when assembling large lists of names, as in the data integrations step of our flora of Alaska project. What is needed is a sensible, transparent algorithm (set of rules) that can be applied by a machine, with human judgement being required in only a small number of cases. As long as the original names are preserved and the details of the automated judgment are recorded, then even if a few matches might later be found to be incorrect, no information is lost. This process of designing a taxonomic matching algorithm and associated software tool has occupied me for the past few weeks.</p>
          <h3 id="existing-tools">Existing tools</h3>
          <p>There do exist online now at least two good tools to help match submitted names to various large names databases: The Global Names <a href="http://resolver.globalnames.org/">Resolver</a> of GNA and iPlant’s <a href="http://tnrs.iplantcollaborative.org/">TNRS</a> (Taxonomic Name Resolution Service). Both of these offer approximate (fuzzy) matching of submitted names to sources such as IPNI and Tropicos. TNRS returns an overall, numeric match score, as does GNR. GNR also returns one of five <code>match_type</code> values (Exact match, Exact match by canonical form of a name, Fuzzy match by canonical form, Partial exact match by species part of canonical form, Partial fuzzy match by species part of canonical form). However, where an non-exact match is found, both tools still require manual checking to confirm the exact nature of that match (e.g., mispelling, differences in author string). For our project’s purpose—building a network of data integrated by names—using the match scores these tools offer is not sufficient.</p>
          <h3 id="botanical-names-deconstructed">Botanical names, deconstructed</h3>
          <p>Because there are general rules that govern the construction of taxonomic names, some additional pattern-matching can be applied in comparing the different elements of two similar names. This can then produce an estimate of the liklihood that two name strings actually refer to the same name.</p>
          <p>The most common elements of a (hypothetical) <em>botanical</em> name are these:</p>
          <pre>
          Salix alaxensis subsp. glauca (Andersson ex DC.) R. Coville ex Jones in Smith
          <---> <-------> <----> <---->  <-------> <---->  <-------->    <--->    <--->
           gen     sp     irank   infr     basio   ex_bas     auth      ex_auth  in_auth 
          
          <--------------------------->    =  taxon_name
          
          <------------->    +   <---->    =  canonical_form
          
                      author_string  =   <-------------------------------------------->
          </pre>
          <p>These codes are:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><code>gen</code>: Genus.</li>
          <li><code>sp</code>: Specific epithet.</li>
          <li><code>irank</code>: Infraspecific rank.</li>
          <li><code>infr</code>: Infraspecific epithet.</li>
          <li><code>basio</code>: Basionym author(s): the author of the specific epithet before a change of genus or of infraspecific rank.</li>
          <li><code>ex_bas</code>: <em>ex</em> Author(s) of basionym (see <code>ex_auth</code>).</li>
          <li><code>auth</code>: Primary author of name: the author responsible for first publishing the combination of <code>gen</code> and <code>sp</code> (and <code>irank</code> and <code>infr</code> if they exist).</li>
          <li><code>ex_auth</code>: <em>ex</em> Author(s) for primary author: if the publication of the name by <code>auth</code> was invalid, the <code>ex_auth</code> was the author who subsequently published the combination validly.</li>
          <li><code>in_auth</code>: <em>in</em> Author(s) for primary author: if <code>auth</code> or <code>ex_auth</code> were responsible for the combination but were not actually the authors of the publication in which that combination first appeared, the author(s) of the publication are should be added after <em>in</em>, usually with some bibliographic citation details following.</li>
          <li><code>taxon_name</code>: <code>gen</code> and <code>sp</code> (and <code>irank</code> and <code>infr</code> if they exist)</li>
          <li><code>canonical_form</code>: <code>gen</code> and <code>sp</code> and <code>infr</code> without <code>irank</code>.</li>
          <li><code>author_string</code>: The whole author string.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="matching-two-variants">Matching two variants</h3>
          <p>The presence or absence of, or variation in, these elements in two names that are being matched indicates different kinds of choices or errors by the person citing the name, and thus can give an indication of the liklihood that the matched names refer to the same name. Here is our current logic, which is encoded into the <code>matchnames</code> software tool (below). The types of variation are approximately ranked in order of decreasing likelihood that the names are truly the same:</p>

          <li>The basionym author (of the specific or infraspecific epithet) should not change, even if a second new combination is made, since the epithet can only have one author.</li>
          <li>It is indeed possible that the same author will have published an infraspecific epithet twice, with different ranks, but seems quite unlikely. It seems more likely that one citing author gave an incorrect rank. However, the overall confidence in the names being the same is low.</li>
          <li>When two or more of these variations are combined (e.g., example B, below), they should generally reduce the likelihood of the two names matching, though probably less than additively.</li>
          <li>“L.” and “L.f.” (= filius) are different people, but in this case the difference was a copying error.</li>
          <li>Since the <code>ex_auth</code> publication is a valid <em>republication</em> of the <code>auth</code> publication it should refer to exactly the same taxon concept as implied by the <code>auth</code> name, and should be effectively interchangable.</li>

          <p>To go beyond a general, numeric match</p>
          <p>To deal with this problem of i) needing more taxonomic precision in judging name similarity, while ii) not having time to check every fuzzy match (and definitely not having time to return to the primary literature for every name encountered), I created a tool that applies a sequence of taxonomic, rule-based transformations to the names, and if a match is then found, records the kind of match. A limited number of non-matching names is subsequently presented to an operator for a human judgement based on details that are more nuanced than could be easily automated.</p>
          <p>The tool is called <code>matchnames</code> (available on <a href="...">Github</a>). Full details of use are in the tool’s <a href="..."><code>man</code> page</a>. The general logical sequence (and output match codes) is as follows:</p>

          <p>Accept a match:</p>
          <ol type="1">
          <li>Spelling variations in the query name or author string.</li>
          <li>If the query name is obviously missing one or more authors seperated by an “&amp;” in the reference string.</li>
          <li>If the query and reference name differ in “var.” vs. “subsp.” <em>and</em> the author strings are the same.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Reject a match:</p>
          <ol type="1">
          <li>When the two author strings are clearly representing non-overlapping lists of authors.</li>
          <li>If the query name contains only the basionym author, and the reference name has the basionym author plus the revising author, or vice versa.</li>
          <li>When the query name is of species rank and the reference name of infraspecific rank, or vice versa.</li>
          <li>If the query name is followed by “auct.”</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Note again: when a manual match is accepted, the matching name is not being accepted as the <em>same</em> as the query name, only that it is judged worth recording as a possible, adjudicated match with a good possibility that it represents the intention of the creator of the query name.</p>
          <p>With large lists this can be a time consuming phase, and is prone to errors due to concentration lapses. Some of these decisions might be achieved with clever code, but I haven’t done that yet.</p>

          <p>Because full recording of data provenance is a core design element of this project, I have chosen to go with the second approach. However, this way adds a layer of complexity, as every query of the taxonomic relationship of two names requires that any orthographic variation be resolved as well (though this resolution may be pre-calculated and cached).</p>
          <p>Although the above diagram shows a single data table, in practice, it seems conceptually clearer to have two tables: a taxonomic relationship table and an orthographic mapping table (especially since eventually we need to model the taxonomic relationships as concept-to-concept relationships, not just name-to-name relationships). So for the moment, my data modeling approach is this:</p>
          <pre>
          +----------+          +-------------+          +----------------+

          <p>…with additional tables to store name-to-name synonymy relationships, and taxon concept relationships.</p>
          <h3 id="an-aside-use-a-graph-database">(An aside: Use a graph database?)</h3>
          <p>Since I first became enamoured with RDF and the smeantic web, I’ve kept an eye on graph databases, and played around with triple stores (<a href="https://github.com/4store/4store">4store</a>, <a href="https://franz.com/agraph/support/documentation/current/agraph-introduction.html">Allegrograph</a>, <a href="https://www.stardog.com/">StarDog</a>, <a href="https://cliopatria.swi-prolog.org/home">ClioPatria</a>) and <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a> and <a href="https://tinkerpop.apache.org/">TinkerPop/Gremlin</a>. I also have a frequently re-occuring desire to learn Prolog, and the conceptual similarity between querying triples and Prolog’s declarative pattern matching tempts me to invest in learning <a href="https://cliopatria.swi-prolog.org/home">ClioPatria</a>, a Prolog-based triple store. So as it became clear that the flora project database would need to include name-to-name mappings, possibly in chains of arbitrary length, I wondered seriously if I should switch to a graph database for the underlying engine for this project. <a href="https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.3.4/tutorials/gremlins-anatomy/">Gremlin</a>, <a href="https://neo4j.com/cypher-graph-query-language/">Cypher</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#propertypath-arbitrary-length">SPARQL 1.1</a> (and Prolog) all allow for searching over arbitrary length property paths.</p>
          <p>In the end I’m deciding to stick to a SQL RDMS solution for reasons of familiarity, stability, speed, and hopeful longevity of the database. But what nailed it was discovering that MariaDB, which is my choice of DB platform, now has <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/recursive-common-table-expressions-overview/">Recursive Common Table Expressions</a>, which permit following a data link chain of arbitrary length until some condition is met. So now I could query across multiple name-to-name orthographic mappings, if needed. Indeed, I hope I won’t need this (SQL is hard enough and ugly enough as it is!), but the facility is there.</p>
          <h2 id="canonical-names">Canonical names</h2>
          <p>Even if we preserve all name variation in the database, the final Flora will need a name string to be chosen for presentation. The choice of which variant is somewhat arbitrary — is the abbreviated author’s name really “better” than the full name? — but having a “canonical” name string for a name will simplify matters. By making all orthographic match assessments only one step from a canonical name, we perhaps will remove the need for recursive searches along orthographic name-to-name chains (see above).</p>
          <p>So which name to chose? I had stated in the <a href="blog1.html">first blog post</a> that we would use <a href="http://www.theplantlist.org/">The Plant List</a> as our reference set. Rod Page rightly took issue with this, asking “why not IPNI?” Unfortunately, IPNI does not contain all the names we may want (neither does The Plant List), so I’ve decided to use a hierarchy of sources to come up with our canonical names set:</p>
          <ol type="1">
          <li>IPNI</li>
          <li>Tropicos</li>
          <li>WCSP (as found in The Plant List)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>I’d have liked to include the Flora of North America (FNA) in this list, probably at rank 2. There’s a team in Ottawa working on parsing and databasing the FNA accounts (including James Macklin, Jocelyn Pender, and Joel Sachs), and they have kindly given me access to the FNA names data, but it will take a while to come to grips with this resource. We will definitely link our Flora to the FNA work, and may include their names in the above canonical name list, but not quite yet.</p>
          <h2 id="appendix-examples-of-judgment-calls-made-during-manual-matching">Appendix: Examples of judgment calls made during manual matching</h2>
          <p>The exact question being asked is: “Despite the variation, do these two name strings refer to the same name as published in the same source?” No judgement about the taxon concept (or circumscription) of the names is being attempted. Symbol key: <code>!=</code> means not the same name; <code>~=</code> means judged to be the same name; <code>?=</code> means judged to be the same name with low confidence.</p>
