  <h1 id="alaska-botany-forum-2018">Alaska Botany Forum 2018</h1>
  <p><strong>22 March, at University of Alaska, Fairbanks</strong></p>
  <p><em>Please join us for botanical fellowship and presentations on the flora of Alaska!</em></p>
  <h2 id="location-date">Location &amp; Date</h2>
  <p>The meeting will be hosted this year by <strong>ALA</strong> (herbarium of the University of Alaska Museum of the North). For the meeting place, we hope to use the conference room of the International Arctic Research Center (West Campus). We will post final directions here and send details to those who have registered. The room has teleconference capability and WiFi access, so we hope to be able to offer remote participation if you are not able to join us in person.</p>
  <p>The date is <strong>22 March</strong>. This is close to the date of the annual <a href="https://sonotkkaazoot.org/">Sonot Kkaazoot</a> ski marathon (24 March), so we hope some of you may be attracted to Fairbanks for botany and skiing! We will begin at 9 AM and continue until 5 PM (depending on the number of presentations). Lunch break will be 90 mins. There is <strong>no registration fee</strong>, but, sorry, we are not able to offer lunch. However there are several dining options within walking distance, and many more within a 5 minute drive. We will offer coffee and snacks.</p>
  <h2 id="presentations">Presentations</h2>
  <p>We hope you will prepare an oral presentation on any topic related to the <strong>wild plants and fungi of Alaska, Yukon or the Russian Far East</strong>, of interest to amateur or professional botanists and mycologists. This includes taxonomy, biogeography, ecology, physiology, genetics, ethnobotany, ethnomycology, and also reports of collecting trips. Horticulture is generally outside the scope of this Forum, but please contact us if you would like to speak on garden-related matters.</p>
  <p>Oral presentations will be 20 minutes in duration, including Q&amp;A. Standard audiovisual equipment will be available, and your slides may be in PPTX, ODP, or PDF formats. Poster display space will also be available and you may prepare a poster in addition to (or instead of) an oral presentation. Poster presenters will be expected to stand by their poster during coffee and tea breaks.</p>
  <p>You are, of course, also most welcome to attend if you do not intend to make a presentation.</p>
  <h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>
  <p>Please register using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lj7_TyV7Om9frVgZZ-T6p3TywHevHhNpgQKSNds6WAY">online form</a>. Registration for new non-presenting attendees will stay open until 20 March. If you have not yet registered and would like to make a presentation, please contact us soon (see below).</p>
  <h2 id="ala-herbarium-activities-and-access">ALA Herbarium activities and access</h2>
  <p>We are planning to have some herbarium activities scheduled at the Museum (within easy walking distance of the planned meeting location). You are also welcome to examine herbarium collections while you are here; please contact us so that we can arrange guest access to the building.</p>
  <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, please contact Steffi Ickert-Bond and/or Cam Webb, using this email address: <a href="mailto:akbf2018@alaskaflora.org">akbf2018@alaskaflora.org</a>.</p>
