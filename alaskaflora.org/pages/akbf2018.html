  <p><em>Please join us for botanical fellowship and presentations on the flora of Alaska!</em></p>
  <p>A sample of topics of planned talks:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Plant species differences: phenotype and genetype</li>
  <li>Plant surveys and plant conservation</li>
  <li>Herbarium data mining</li>
  <li>Herbivores and plant physiology</li>
  <li>Tree phenology</li>
  <li>Vegetation succession and vegetation databases</li>
  <li>Taxon concepts</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="location-date">Location &amp; Date</h2>
  <p>The meeting will be hosted this year by <strong>ALA</strong> (herbarium of the University of Alaska Museum of the North). We will meet in <strong>Room 501 </strong> (top floor) of the <strong>International Arctic Research Center</strong> (<a href="https://uaf-iarc.org/">IARC</a>), UAF West Campus, 2160 Koyukuk Dr., Fairbanks, AK 99775 (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/es7sh4hNftJ2">MAP</a>).</p>
  <p>The date is <strong>22 March</strong>. We will begin at <strong>9 AM</strong> and continue until 5 PM (depending on the number of presentations). Lunch break will be 90 mins. There is <strong>no registration fee</strong>, but, sorry, we are not able to offer lunch. However there are several dining options within walking distance, and many more within a 5 minute drive. We will offer coffee and snacks.</p>
  <h2 id="presentations">Presentations</h2>
  <p>We hope you will prepare an oral presentation on any topic related to the <strong>wild plants and fungi of Alaska, Yukon or the Russian Far East</strong>, of interest to amateur or professional botanists and mycologists. This includes taxonomy, biogeography, ecology, physiology, genetics, ethnobotany, ethnomycology, and also reports of collecting trips. Horticulture is generally outside the scope of this Forum, but please contact us if you would like to speak on garden-related matters.</p>
  <p>Oral presentations will be 20 minutes in duration, including Q&amp;A. Standard audiovisual equipment will be available, and your slides may be in PPTX, ODP, or PDF formats. Poster display space will also be available and you may prepare a poster in addition to (or instead of) an oral presentation. Poster presenters will be expected to stand by their poster during coffee and tea breaks.</p>
  <p>You are, of course, also most welcome to attend if you do not intend to make a presentation.</p>
