## usage: qsplit(string, array [, sep [, qualifier] ])
## a version of split() designed for CSV-like data. splits "string" on "sep"
## (,) if not provided, into array[1], array[2], ... array[n]. returns "n", or
## "-1 * n" if the line is incomplete (it has an uneven number of quotes). both
## "sep" and "qualifier" will use the first character in the provided string.
## uses "qualifier" (" if not provided) and ignores "sep" within quoted fields.
## doubled qualifiers are considered escaped, and a single qualifier character
## is used in its place. for example, foo,"bar,baz""blah",quux will be split as
## such: array[1] = "foo"; array[2] = "bar,baz\"blah"; array[3] = "quux";
