# Blog 5: Assembling the canonical names list

_Posted by [Cam](people.html#cam) on 2019-01-28_

Hi again! Having got hold of most of the “engines”, taken them apart,
laid out the parts, tried to jam them together several times, I’m now
ready to document the details of assembling our integrated names list.
Work over the past months has been “two steps forward, one-and-a-half
steps back” as I learned about the complexities an limitations of each
source database database and the challenges of integrating
them. Actually, I think that’s how the work will be all the way
through this project! But I think I now have a good base _canonical
names list_. This is a master list of names:

 1. from “core” online names resources (i.e., not derived; see
 [blog 2](blog2.html)),
 2. ranked by name resource “quality” (IPNI > Tropicos > World
 Checklist of Selected Plant Families),
 3. internally reconciled to remove duplicates and orthographic variants,
 4. each with a Globally Unique Identifier (with a live URL), and,
 5. including almost all names applied to Alaskan plants (at least
 which are available online).

The list itself makes no note of status (currently accepted
vs. synonym); that comes next.

The steps to assemble this list were:

 1. Obtain a “rough list” of names for Alaskan plants from a variety
 of sources: the ACCS checklist (currently
 [here](https://floraofalaska.org/comprehensive-checklist/)), the ALA
 herbarium checklist assembled by Dave Murray and colleagues
 ([here](ALA_checklist.html)), the Alaskan names in the
 [Panarctic Flora](http://panarcticflora.org), ...
