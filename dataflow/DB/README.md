# Assembling names into a database

For each new resource:

 1. Add all new names to `names` table (a name is new if its md5sum is
    not matched in `names.md5sum`).  For the original canonical list, the 
    status of `names.canonical` is set to `T`.
 2. Insert the uid strings into `uids` for all new names added. For
    the original canonical list, link the canonical name to the canonical
    uid.
 
Hereâ€™s the ER diagram of the database:
